/*
In this approch we store in 2D array of V*V dimention V is the no of vertices
Where adj[i][j] represnet -?
if 1 then there is an edge from i to j
if 0 then no edge from i to j
How to reperesent the weight->?
Then adj[i][j] stores any value
Dense Graph and Sparse Graph
  

Incidence Matrix->
In this approch we prepare a V*E matrix where V is the no of vertixes and E is Edges
M[i][j]= if 1 ith vertex belongs to the jth edge
             0
