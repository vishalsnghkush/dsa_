// first way is to do by comparing the value of left and right if the value of left is less than the right max(of) then it is true 
// and simplarly the min of right side is greater than that of root

// second way is to fill the vector of inorder
// since the inorder tranverse give the sorted form 
// if the vector is in sorted form then it is sorted form 
// that's it
