 OOPS Object Oriented Programming->> is a methedology or paradiagm to design a program using objects and classes
 types:

 Data Abstraction -> 

 --->>Abstraction means hiding somethings like the taking the eg of game if we look that then we just show their final output like the no of member who is alive  but we can't known the behind the sense;;.


 Data Encapsulation --->>
  --->> Encapsulation it's like  the taking somethings into a somewhere and put them there ....
  
  like taking the example 
  class Player{
    int helth;
    int score;
    string name;
  };./
here we can Encapsulation the helth,score,name put into a single things

 INHERITANCE   -->>
 Just like the Inheritance ....ye us tareh ke liye use kiya jata hai jaha pr same time ko data hoga then here we want's to inherirt from the other / parent sources;;


 Polymorphism-->>
 poly means many    Morph Means Form ... Same code se different functionalty hold kr sakte hai ...to be studied later..

 scalibilty -> means just the code is running it's means
 there is an no thinking about the speed

Classes: --->
Class is -> user defined data type
