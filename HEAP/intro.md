priority queue

what and why?  :-> : ->
BST ->Searching O(log n)
insertion ka bhi same hota hai O(log n)


HEAP-->>
-push pop and top hote hai
just like stack


heap me at every instant max element at the top pe raheta hai maximum ke alawa wale sab random order hi hota hai


if we wants a Data structure in which we can always get the maimum or min elemrnt at any point of time then we use the priority queue or (heap)


two types of heap-?

maxheap-->default : max element at on the top

minheap--> min element is one the top

 
minHeap --> priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>> pq
