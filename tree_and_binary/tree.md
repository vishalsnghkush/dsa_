What is tree data staructure??
ANS->
Array ,LL Stack,Queue->Linera Data structure
Trees and Graph is non linear data structure


Representation->>

Childrens hote hai just like an node in linked list
Root->...Childern hote hai

Terminology-->>

Root
Child Node-> Root ke next
Parent Node
Sibling Nodes
Leaf Node->No child Nodes
Internal Node
Ancestor Node
Descendant Node
Level->Generation
Number of edges =size-1;
Height-->level-1;
Size->No of nodes


Important properties of trees-->>

Traversing in a tree is done by depth first seatch and breadth first search algorithm...
It has no loop and no circuit...
It has no self loop.


Type of trees-->>
Generic Tree-> Multiple childeren 

Binary Tree->> 0,1,2 childern hote hai
upto 2 child hote hai 
Every node has an value and its left child address and right child address

Binary seach tree-> Binary tree with some special property
AVL trees->Balanced Binary search tree

Application of tree data stucture->>
1.Hierarchical Data Structure
2.searching efficiency
3.sorting dynamic data
4.efficient insertion and deletion
5.easy to implement

Binary Tree??->
Tree that can have 0,1,2 nodes
