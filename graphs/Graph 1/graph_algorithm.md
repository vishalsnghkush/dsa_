Graph Algorithm -> Collection of Node or verticles which represent the real life entities ....Vertex and Edges


The Nodes represnet real life entities and are connected by edge representing thr reletionship between the nodes or entities


Discreate Algorithm  -> Techanically it is an mathematical tools 


Mathematical Definition of Graphs ->
Graph is defined as a pair  G = (V,E) 

Graph is an ordered pair of set V and set E representing vertices and edge respectively

Types of Graphs->
1. Direction Based ->
 a. Undirected  -> Direction na ho
 b. Directed    -> Direction ho

2. Edge Weight
 a. Unweighted Graph -> No data on the edges
 b. Weighted Graph   -> Having some data on the Edges


Termonologies in Graph->

1. MultiGraph-> An undirected graph in which multiple edges are allowed between 2 nodes

2. Simple Graph -> An undirected graph in which  both multiple edges and loop are not allowed

3. Complete -> An compete graph is the are in which every node is DIRECTLY connected to each other

4. Connected -> In this graph we have an direct or indirect path for every possible pair of values

5. Cycle -> An graph in which vertex are in circular form

6. DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph)

7. Degree -> Degree of a vertex in a graph is the total no of edges incident to it or away from it.

8. CC-> The set of vertices which are connected from an connected component


Facts->
Tree NO of edges- > vertex-1

for forest vertex-1 is (max val)

Connected graph-> V-1  (min)

Undirected Complete ->  E=V C 2

Directed  -> E = V * (V-1)
