special type
important
there are some questions
cyclic sort ....O(n)  only for some question use krte hai
where to use?
array 1-n / 0-n / 1-n pe kuch kam krna hai


algorithm->>

array=[5,1,2,4,3]  given all element to 1 to 5 in jumblled order
 go to the 0 th index and look at it correct position i.e 
 say 5 then it's correct index is 5-1 = 4th index then swap it..
 new array is
 [3,1,2,4,5] again the pointer is at 0th index ..and it is there until the elemnt at there is correct index..
 e.g 
 3 swap with 3-1=2th index value
 new array is
 2 1 3 4 5
 again 2 swap with 2-1 = 1th index then 
 1 2 3 4 5
 affter checking the 1-1 =0th index value e.g 1 if it is at correct position then the pointer movers to the next index
